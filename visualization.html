    <div class=" para w-full ml-10 pr-5 text-left">Disaster management is a complex and dynamic process that requires efficient resource distribution to minimize damage and loss of life. Effective allocation of resources can significantly improve response time, optimize relief efforts, and enhance the resilience of affected communities. However, the method used to distribute resources plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of disaster response strategies.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="para w-full ml-10 pr-5 text-left">This report presents a detailed comparison between two key methods of resource distribution:</div>
    <div class="para w-full ml-10 pr-5 text-left"><span class="font-bold">Equal Distribution  </span>‚Äì This method involves allocating resources evenly across all affected areas, regardless of the specific impact severity, population density, or other critical factors. While this approach ensures that every region receives some level of aid, it may not always be the most efficient way to address the varying needs of different areas</div>
    <div class="para w-full ml-10 pr-5 text-left"><span class="font-bold">Data Driven Distribution</span>This method utilizes a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based data ingestion system to analyze various factors such as flood impact severity, population density, rainfall levels, infrastructure damage, and other relevant parameters. By leveraging real-time data and predictive analytics, resources can be allocated more effectively to regions that are in greater need, ensuring a more targeted and optimized disaster response.</div>
